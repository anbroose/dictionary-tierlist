# Dictionary Tier List

A web application that allows users to rank words from a predefined dictionary into a tier list. The rankings are saved locally, allowing users to resume their progress even after a page reload.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to get started locally.

## Extra info
This app is using the free dictionary API to provide a multitude of words to rate. Please go support the devs there as without this API this project would not be as easy as it was. You can find the API site [https://dictionaryapi.dev/](here) with donation links.
